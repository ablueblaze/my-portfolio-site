Movie list:

- This project was built from a design file from the Front end Scrimba course.
  The idea was to allow the user to search for a movie from a title keyword search, and then be given the ability to add or remove movies to a watch list.
  The big things about this project was working with api's, and development planning. I had to decide how I wanted to approach the project without outside help.
  I ultimately decided to build it as a single page app that would manipulate the DOM when the user wanted to switch between the search and watch "pages."
  I also went with building the visual elements first. Mainly because I wanted to have a more developed space to work with when I started implementing the api search and watch-list functions. But also because when I have a prebuilt design file, it allows me to build up momentum early in the project. Making the more bugs that crop up easier to handle.

- This was the first solo project I did after I decided to start taking coding seriously as a new career choice.
  I remember spending hours trying to solve the resizing problem of this app. Generating a two dimensional array, and applying event listeners to it was incredibly hard!
  Though, looking back at it now all I do is smile. It reminds me of the choice that I made, and the joy of getting the thing to work for the first time. Knowing that I was the one to do it.
  I included this project as a kind of touch stone. An example of where I started, and a reminder to myself to stay humble as I progress on this difficult and wonderful path.

- I enjoyed working on this one. This was the first "Major" React app that I built. And man was it a great challenge.
  I initially focused on the styling of the project for two reasons. First being that I had a full design file to work from, so getting the basic visuals into place was an easy start. Second was because one of the core components to this project was about the changeable theme.
  Deciding on what what components to build was a bit difficult, because I wasn't sure if I wanted to have separate components for the function buttons, or just a universal button, and have it incorporate the relevant functionality.
  Looking back at it, I realize that I used several method of building that I had grown used to in just pure JS. The problem with that was that now I know that they don't really fit with the way React is used. Which is Great!
  I've grown to understand that there are a few key elements to coding that I truly enjoy.
  Everything is about learning. No matter if you do it perfectly and are super efficient in building an algorithm, or have built the clunkiest app you've every seen. You've learned something.
  Get it going, then make it pretty. This one I like to call "Keep it Clunky!" Because I try to not worry about making amazingly optimized code in the initial build. I know that software rot, or debt is a problem, but I like to approach the 'clean code' methodology by building small clunky parts that work first, then cleaning them up after.
