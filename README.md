## Overview

### Project Outline

- This will be version 0.1 of my portfolio

  - I would like for this to become a living document as my skills progress.
    As I learn new things, and develop a more founded style of development I'll come back to this project and update it.
    Giving me experience in updating sites, as well as learning about and refining my own methods.

  - In the beginning, for the first version I'm going with K.I.S.S.

- Things you want to learn, or get a better handle on?
