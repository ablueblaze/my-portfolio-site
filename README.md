### Current/Continued Development

- What would I like to do to improve the project in the future?
  - The accessability
- Potential feature list?

## My Process

### Plan outline:

### Built With

- Included technologies:
  React
  Tailwind CSS
  Vite
  Github

### What I Learned

- Not to over-reach. Especially in an area where I'm just not skilled (Design).
- To Keep your initial build really simple, because it's easier to change an existing clean build rather than having to build from scratch.
