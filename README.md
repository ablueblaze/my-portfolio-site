## Overview

### Project Outline

- This will be version 1 of my portfolio

  - I would like for this to become a living document as my skills progress.
    As I learn new things, and develop a more founded style of development I'll come back to this project and update it.
    Giving me experience in updating sites, as well as learning about and refining my own methods.

  - In the beginning, for the first version I'm going with K.I.S.S.
    - I failed at keeping it simple, so I went even simpler. The original design was to much. And while I look forward to making this worthy of the "Page of the day" at some point, right now I would rather have a simple but usable and live project vs a fancy one that's beyond buggy.

- Things you want to learn, or get a better handle on?
  - How to keep the MVP as simple, good looking, and changeable.
  - How to properly set up accessability
  - Tailwind css

### Current/Continued Development

- What would I like to do to improve the project in the future?
  - Better nav bar
  - More interesting visual actions. (The spinning is to simple)
- Potential feature list?

## My Process

- For this one my process was a little strange. I had some of base elements built based on the design file I originally made when I realized that it was going to look like crap and take way longer than I alloted myself for this project.
  So I changed tactics. I scrapped the design file, then looked at what I had already made. Then I built a much simpler design.

### Plan outline:

### Built With

- Included technologies:
  React
  Tailwind CSS
  Vite
  Gthumb

### What I Learned

- Not to over-reach. Especially in an area where I'm just not skilled (Design).
- To Keep your initial build really simple, because it's easier to change an existing clean build rather than having to build from scratch.
